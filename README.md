Academic Presentation
====================

This repository is my 'work in progress' academic presentation library that is based heavily on two projects designs:

1. [Google's IO 2012 slides](https://code.google.com/p/io-2012-slides/)
2. [The mtheme beamer package](https://github.com/matze/mtheme)

Although this project is based on the visual aspects of these two projects, the only dependeny is jQuery.

Guidelines
----------

Pull requests are always welcome. All of my packages follow the Unix mindset of doing one thing very well in contrast to trying to do several things fairly well. Pull requests should prioritize simplicity and readability, as most of my packages are meant to be heavily modified after being downloaded.

This package is *unlicensed*, so do what you please.
